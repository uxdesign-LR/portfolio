                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify mt-5">Plunet GmbH sells a flexible and customizable SaaS software (Plunet BusinessManager - PBM) with a complex interface. Ensuring PBM's usability is important to help industry professionals complete tasks more quickly and securely.</p>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">I've set up several projects within the company to improve PBM usability. This page describes the two main projects I've carried out: establishing an objective measure to evaluate the usability of the software, and exploring two usability-related topics, accessibility and responsiveness.</p>

                        <h3>Context</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">Measuring PBM's usability faces two main obstacles. The first is that the software does not allow for tracking behavioral data. The second is that the software is so flexible and customizable that user experiences can vary widely. <br /> What method would enable us to overcome these two obstacles, and provide a valid and reliable measurement to the Product Team? </p>
                         <h3>Process</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">I started by facilitating a workshop with the product team to clarify their needs. This workshop enabled us to define what we wanted to achieve with the measurement, the desired measurement frequency and the acceptable margin of error.</p>
                         
                         <figure>

                         </figure>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">Considering the team's needs and the software's limitations, I decided that the Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ) was the best choice for a global usability evaluation. This questionnaire focuses on overall user experience and is broad enough to cover multiple aspects of usability.</p>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">I then set up the survey and distributed it twice, four months apart. The first survey had 39 participants, and the second had 49, with 15 of these users participating in both rounds.</p>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">By repeating the survey, I could test the stability of the results over time (since no major changes were made to the interface in four months) and conduct reliability and validity tests. These tests confirmed the quality of the results and validity of the method.</p>
                         <h3>Results</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom">Evaluating PBM's usability score enabled me to compare its situation with the industry standard. By repeating this evaluation every year, the company is now able to monitor the evolution of the usability of PBM interface over time.</p>

                        <h3>Context</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">Usability involves considering alternative ways of using the product, such as when it's used by individuals with limited abilities (accessibility) or on smaller interfaces like smartphones (responsiveness). To enhance PBM usability, the Product Team has decided to better account for these alternative uses during software development.  <br /> To support informed decision-making, I initiated a research project to explore user needs and alternative product usage.</p>
                         <h3>Process</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">The process was the same for both accessibility and responsiveness. I conducted two surveys for each topic — one internal survey with teams that interact with users, and one external survey with the users themselves. This approach provided a larger dataset and helped to cross-check the different perspectives. The results were used to inform the teams on the subject, and to prepare a decision-making workshop.</p>

                         </figure>
                         <h3>Results</h3>
                         <p class="lead-bottom text-justify">The factual resources presented during the workshop were well received by management. Several decisions were taken, notably on front-end technology usage — design elements based on the Angular Material frontend library will no longer be customized. The aim is to preserve as much as possible the properties of the library's elements, which are responsive and accessible by default. </p>
